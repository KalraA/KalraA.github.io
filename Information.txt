Problem Solver | Machine Learning Expert

I believe that machine learning is all about problem solving and learning the tools required to solve the problem at hand. Tools are just a means to an end.

Deep Learning Toolkit:

	Models with which I am theoritically and practically proficient: 

	FCNN; 
	RNN - LSTMs, GRUs, Simple RNNs; 
	CNN - Convolutions, Pooling, Inception Modules; 
	CRNN;
	Deep Belief Network;
	Sum-Product Networks;

	Libraries/Languages that I have used:

	Python - Tensorflow, Theano, Keras, Graphlab Create and MATLAB

Reinforcement Learning Toolkit:

	Models with which I am theoritically and practically proficient:

	Q - Learning
	Deep Q Learning
	Policy Gradient REINFORCE
	Genetic Breeding

Other Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence Toolkit:

	Models I have used and mathematically understood:
	
	SVMs
	Clustering
	Regressions
	Gradient Descent
